    <p>Coelophysis was a carnivorous dinosaur that lived approximately 210 million years ago in the late Triassic period, and was also one of the first dinosaurs to have ever existed. A large number of Coelophysis fossils have been found in the New Mexico region. A long tail and its agility are among some of the features that characterized Coelophysis.</p>

        <p>Coelophysis lived during the late Triassic period (approximately 210 million years ago) in southwest North America. Hundreds of Coelophysis fossils have been found in the Ghost Ranch quarry of New Mexico, which is why it is the state fossil of New Mexico. The fossils found in the Ghost Ranch quarry are thought to have died due to flash floods resulting from periodic monsoon rains, explaining why such a high concentration of Coelophysis fossils have been found in that area. Coelophysis was one of the first dinosaurs to have ever existed. They lived before the golden age of dinosaurs in dry, desert-like areas with a savanna-type climate (similar to Kenya).</p>

        <p>Coelophysis was a carnivorous dinosaur that ate vertebrates. Coelophysis translates to "hollow form" due to its hollow vertebrae which made Coelophysis a swift and agile predator. Coelophysis also had sharp recurved and serrated teeth, which were effective in cutting through flesh. Coelophysis was suspected to have hunter smaller, quick-moving animals in packs.</p>
        <p>Once mistaken to be cannibalistic, it was later revealed that it was actually fossilized crurotarsan reptiles that were in Coelophysis' fossilized abdomen, as opposed to its offspring.</p>

            <p>Coelophysis was a lightly built dinosaur that was small in size and walked on two legs. It was carnivorous, theropodous and almost 9 feet long. It had light and hollow bones, long and pointed yet flexible neck and small pointed head. This carnivorous dinosaur had dozens of small and serrated teeth. Due to this, it was a fast and agile runner. The torso of this species conforms to a basic body shape of this theropod but its pectoral girdle exhibits some remarkable special characteristics. It had a furcular which is the earliest known characteristics of a dinosaur (Buckley, & Currie, 2014). It had narrow hips and open acetabulum along with straight ankle hinge which is the main characteristic of a dinosaur.  The forelimbs were used for grasping. The long tail had interlocked prezygapophysis of vertebrae, that formed a semi-rigid lattice, which stopped the tail from moving up and down.

        <h1 class="text-center" style="font-size:28pt; margin-top:-10px;">Reproduction</h1>
            <p>Coelophysis, like other dinosaur species, reproduced by laying eggs. Each female Coelophysis laid between 24-26 eggs. The evidence shows that parental care was needed to the comparatively small hatchlings in their initial years. The females needed a lot of energy at the time of reproduction, like other extinct reptiles of similar size.

            <p>Fossilized skeletons of Coelophysis were found containing what was once thought the bones of young ones in their bodies. This evidence demonstrates that unlike other reptiles, Coelophysis was theorized to eat young babies after birth because the skeletons found in the rib cages or abdomens were once thought of young Coelophysis. Moreover, it was suggested that they used to eat each other when opportunity arose (Brink et al., 2015). However, the thoughts of cannibalistic behaviour were disproven after it was discovered that the fossilized skeletons found in Coelophysis' abdomen were actually from crurotarsan reptiles.

        <p>Coelophysis, more specifically C. bauri, resides in the taxonomic clade of the Coelphysidae which are a group of carnivorous, theropod dinosaurs. The evolution of the Coelophysis generated two additional taxonomic groups, C. longicollis and C. willistoni. The family of Coelophysis existed in the late Triassic and Early Jurassic periods but went extinct shortly after. Another species, Megapnosaurus, was discovered to have lived during the same period and brought upon much controversy interms of its relationship with Coelophysis. It was later proved to have been another form of Coelophysis, giving it the name C. rhodesiensis.
